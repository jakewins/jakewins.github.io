For anyone who has been following the news and knows the history of Lake Oahe and its 
contruction knows there's nothing new under the sun: The Standing Rock Siuox are getting hosed.

However. In what has become a massively infected debate, the alternative of not building the pipeline, 
and the implications of that, are lost.

This is an argument that, on environmental grounds, it is imperative the pipeline is built.

## First

If you only care about the argument itself, you can skip to "The Argument" below. 
However, there are some things I want to have said before I get to that.

Native Lives Matter. This is not an argument for bulldozing Sioux burial grounds. 
If the pipeline is to be built, it *must* be done with proper surveys as the tribe is asking.

This is not an argument pretending the pipeline is not on Sioux land; that the government took it in 1948 to build a dam does
not morally mean it belongs to the public.

This is not an argument that the Sioux had their day in court.
It is [hard to deny](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2016cv1534-39)
that the Corps tried for several months to get input on their decision and were snubbed by Waste’ Win Young, 
the Tribe’s Historic Preservation Officer.
However, the fact that one man thought the pipeline unimportant to the tribe does not morally mean those kept 
in the dark have no right to protest.

## On The Missouri

I love the Missouri River.
I love fishing in it's tributaries. 
I love watching its currents throw a hundred foot pine like a toothpick.
I love thinking of the crunch of snow under the tent in Yellowstone and the journey the water makes, as the sun sets over it here in Missouri.


All this, I guess, is a round-about way of saying I hope we make the decision that has the best possible impact on the river
and the massive ecosystem of life of all forms that it supports.

## The Argument

In an ideal world, we would have stopped using oil by now, and this would all be moot.

Instead, we seem to have two choices:

- Build the pipeline, in some form
- Keep using the oil trains

What I will argue is two things: The trains are more exposed to the river, and the trains spill more oil.
Assuming I can get you on board with those two ideas, I hope that I can have you agree with me that, at least
as far as the river ecosystem is concerned, the pipeline is the less horrible choice.

### The trains are more exposed to the river

I'll start with this one, since it's easier. 

The pipeline [crosses the river in two places](http://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/docs-dapl/DAPL_States_Counties.pdf):
Once in north-western North Dakota close to Williston, and again just north of the 
Standing Rock Reservation. A leak in either of those two places would have horrific consequences.

The rail road, however, for historical reasons [*follows*](http://priceofoil.org/rail-map/) the rivers. 
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe parallels the Yellowstone river for several hundred miles before it joins the Missouri.
The same railroad crosses the Missouri twice, spans the entirety of the Standing Rock Reservation and snakes 
along the Missouri north of the Standing Rock Reservation all the way to Washburn, ND.

Meaning, a leak along massive distances of rail would spell crude oil in the Missouri, compared to just two locations
for the pipeline.

### The trains spill more oil

The prior point is irrelevant if the pipeline spills significantly more oil than the rail roads.
ThinkProgress has an [article](https://thinkprogress.org/data-oil-trains-spill-more-often-but-pipelines-spill-bigger-9533009d4aba#.3uivdnnb2)
on this topic, where they say:

> U.S. pipelines spilled three times as much crude oil as trains over [the period of 2004 to 2012]

They go on to explain that this is probably because pipeline spills are larger than train spills.

However, they fail to mention that their source for this says, in the next paragraph, that
[pipelines account for 75% of US crude oil transport, while rail accounts for 0.3%](http://www.iea.org/ieaenergy/issue6/rail-vs-pipelines-how-to-move-oil.html).

If you take this into account, you find that *for every gallon of oil spilled by a pipeline, the trains will spill about 83 gallons.* <sup>1</sup>


### The pipeline is the better choice

Since it's election year, "lesser of two evils" seems a worn moniker.

If the railroad didn't run along the rivers, and only had the two crossings like the pipeline does, historic
data says we should expect almost a hundred times more oil in the Missouri river if we use the railroad instead of pipeline.

However, this is not the case. The railroad crosses at two points *and* it runs for hundreds of miles along
the rivers. Given a leak at any point along either system, the likelihood that the railroad leak enters the
river is higher by at least an order of magnitude.

Hence: Focusing solely on the environmental impact, the pipeline can be expected to spill 1,000 times less
oil into the ecosystem than the system that will be used if it is not built.       
    
#### Footnotes
     
<sup>1</sup> Using the numbers from the IEA article, we get:

    Pipe-to-rails ratio for spills: 3:1
    Pipe-to-rails ratio for transport: 75:0.3

    Spills per percent transported:
      (3 / 75) : (1 / 0.3)  
      0.04 : 3.33

    Normalized:
      (0.04 / 0.04) : (3.33 / 0.04)
      1 : 83.25
